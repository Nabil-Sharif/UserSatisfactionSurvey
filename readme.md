My repository includes HTML and CSS code for a basic user satisfaction survey form. 

DISCLAIMER: My survey form does not currently include any logic to "submit" the survey.

<img width="616" alt="User Satisfaction Survey Form"  src="https://github.com/Nabil-Sharif/UserSatisfactionSurvey/assets/8103657/33ee6f2a-ba01-44c4-b24a-1656a33309c4">

**HTML Structure:**
- 'SurveyFormProject.html' includes semantic elements such as "main", "form","fieldset", and "label".
- Users can provide their name, email, age, overall satisfaction rating, quality rating, user experience rating, customer support satisfaction, improvement suggestions, and additional comments.

**CSS Styling:**
- 'SurveyFormProjectCSS.css' enhances form appearance with a background color, alignment, font styles, and consistent spacing.
- Rules for input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons ensure a cohesive design.

Feel free to take a look at my code and use it if you would like in creating or inspiring your own user satisfaction survey.
